    description: `This case shows how chaplains accompany colleagues in law enforcement (as well as the military) in making death notifications. It models how death notifications are made and what about the protocol changes if the death was caused by suicide. The case also demonstrates how chaplains support family members and colleagues from the death notification through the funeral or memorial service and beyond, including offering training in suicide prevention. The case encourages all involved in such difficult situations to care for themselves.
